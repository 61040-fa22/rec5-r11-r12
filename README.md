## Setup

Server runs at http://localhost:3000, but can be configured by changing the port.

* Run `npm install` to install dependences.
* Run `npm run dev` to launch the server for live-reloading on every file save (note: value changes and sessions may be lost due to a lack of persistent storage)
* Run `npm start` to launch the server normally.
